      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I'm a passionate third-year Computer Science student who thrives on tackling challenges head-on.<br></br>
      I’ve had the opportunity to lead projects and find efficient solutions to complex problems.<br></br>
      I truly enjoy collaboration, and I’m eager to bring my skills into junior development roles or part-time positions where I can continue to learn and grow.
